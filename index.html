            <p class="subsectiontag small-text">An Education index is a component of the Human Development Index
                published every year by the United Nations Development Programme. Alongside the GDP Index and Life
                Expectancy Index, it helps measure the educational attainment, GDP per capita and life expectancy of
                countries.

                Since 2010, the education index has been measured by combining average adult years of schooling with
                expected years of schooling for students under the age of 25, each receiving 50% weighting. Before 2010,
                the education index was measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weighting) and the combined
                primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (with one-third weighting).

                Education is a major component of well-being and is used in the measure of economic development and
                quality of life, which is a key factor determining whether a country is a developed, developing, or
                underdeveloped country</p>

            <p class="subsectiontag small-text">TransformEd is a nationally-recognized non-profit organization that
                partners with school systems and other education-focused organizations to support educators in fostering
                the development of the whole child so that all students, particularly those from underserved
                populations, can thrive. TransformEd works directly with district, CMO, school, and organization
                partners across the United States to integrate a whole child approach, while also producing open-source,
                evidence-based tools, resources, and guides for educators.As a parent of two African American boys, I am
                concerned as we begin to navigate our way back into the school building. I am worried that this new era
                in education could make my children and other BIPOC children vulnerable to disproportionate school
                discipline, especially exclusionary discipline. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

            <p class="subsectiontag small-text">Poor quality education is leading to poor learning outcomes in India,
                ultimately pushing children out of the education system and leaving them vulnerable to child labour,
                abuse and violence. Many classrooms continue to be characterized by teacher-centred rote learning,
                corporal punishment and discrimination.

                Learning assessments show that many of those children who are in school are not learning the basics of
                literacy and numeracy or the additional knowledge and skills necessary for their all-round development
                as specified under the Right to Education Act.

                Much remains to be done to ensure a child-friendly learning environment where all children benefit from
                gender-sensitive and inclusive classrooms, as well as the availability of improved water, sanitation and
                hygiene, and mid-day meal Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Fuga dolores optio,
